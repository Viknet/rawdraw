# rawdraw

**This fork was created only for testing different drawing methods on macOS.**

An OS-Agnostic (including No OS AT ALL!) drawing system.  It includes lines, boxes, linetext, points, bitmaps.  

The drawing method can either be by the OS (i.e. SetPixel in Windows), Rasterized in software (we draw our own lines) or by OpenGL where available.

(BTW You can use Rawdraw to open OpenGL Windows!)

It runs on Windows, Linux, OSX*, and bare metal of a variety of systems.  When I rendered 3D on my ESP8266, it was with rawdraw!

Somewhere unusual and want to open a window and draw stuff?  Use rawdraw.

Other packages too big, bulky or include junk you don't want?  Use rawdraw.




 OSX Support is not full-fledged.
